			<summary>My Childhood</summary>
			I was born in Giza, Egypt, but I grew up in Cairo. For the longest time I <br>didn't know what my passion was nor which faculty should I join, but <br>thankfully, I found out that my true passion and happiness lies in <br>
			helping other people, and I realized that I could accomplish this <br>
			by joining the faculty of Informatics & Computer Science. &lt;3 <br>
